# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)


# User.create([
#     {username: "h_annah", first_name: "hannah", last_name: "r", password: "test"},
#     {username: "A_manda", first_name: "Amanda", last_name: "b", password: "test"},
#     {username: "e_lombardo", first_name: "eric", last_name: "l", password: "test"},
#     ])

# faker gem

# 10.times do 
#     User.create(username: Faker::Name)
